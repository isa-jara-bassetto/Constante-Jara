Independent Researcher focused on Dark Matter and Cosmology. Creator of the Jara Constant (1.44 \times 10^{-18} kg/m³) for GRB spectral lag validation

My research indicates that the vacuum is not an "absolute void" but possesses a specific density defined by the **Jara Constant** ($\rho_J = 1.44 \times 10^{-18} kg/m³$).

This implies that the light speed observed across cosmological distances undergoes a slight correction. The formula proposing this effective velocity ($v_J$) is:

$$v_J = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{\rho_J}{\rho_c}}$$

**Key Findings:**
Light "interacts" with this dark matter density, which explains the **Spectral Lag** detected in NASA satellite data. This model expands Einstein's relativity by considering the cosmic medium's density, proving that space-time is a material fluid rather than an empty stage.
